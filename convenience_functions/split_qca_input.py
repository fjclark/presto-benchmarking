"""Functionality to split QCArchive inputs into validation and test sets.

The JSON outputs contain all molecules (including duplicates, as multiple torsions
may reference the same molecule). The SMILES outputs (CSV and individual .smi files)
are deduplicated: two entries are considered the same molecule if their canonical
SMILES strings match after stripping atom-map numbers from the mapped SMILES.

Split behaviour
---------------
When ``frac_test=1.0`` the MaxMin splitter is **not** called at all: every entry
is assigned to the test set and the validation set is empty. This avoids a
DeepChem quirk whereby ``train_test_split`` always reserves at least one sample
for its internal "test" bucket — which, because the train/test roles are swapped
here, would silently leak one molecule into the validation set even when the
caller explicitly requests no validation split.
